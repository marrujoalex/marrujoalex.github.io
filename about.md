Hi! I'm a Software Engineer from Orange, CA. I work on mobile development using Swift or Kotlin, and web development using C#, Go, Swift for my backend projects, and ReactJS for my front-end. 

### More Information

Some of my hobbies include working out, practicing Muay Thai, going to electronic music festivals, and learning new code paradigms or languages.

Currently, Swift is my favorite language, and I'm excited to see how Swift develops as ABI Stability churns out successfully.
